# Diabetes Prediction Model Repository

## Model Development, Interpretation and Evaluation
The model is a logistic regression model which predicts if a patient has diabetes.

The R script (src/diabetes_model.R) contains the code for exploratory data analysis, model development, model evaluation and model interpretation. 

## Dataset
The dataset (data/dataset.dta) for this project is a modified version of the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset from Kaggle. 

Original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

## Report
The report (report/diabetes_model_report.pdf) had a 1500 word limit and was written in line with the following guidelines:
- A detailed description of how each variable is treated including measures of central tendency and dispersion, any identification of outliers and any decisions to categorise continuous variables into clinically significant groups
- Include a discussion of your modelling decisions made. Justification for any transformation of your predictors and any creation of new features. 
- Description of model evaluation including the metrics used to implement internal validation and rationale for choosing them. 
- Description of any sensitivity analyses conducted to assess model robustness
- An interpretation of the results and conclusion about the overall study question.
